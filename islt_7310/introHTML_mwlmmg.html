    Hi, my name is Martin Lewis and I am a junior here at the University of Missouri. I am studying accounting and plan on graduating with my Masterâ€™s in December 2023. I enjoy playing basketball, working out, and reading in my free time. I am in the middle of an information technology class that involves Python and programming but besides that, I have no experience with web application or development. My expectations for this course are just to get a better understanding of how websites and applications truly work behind the scenes. Understanding how these web applications work is fascinating and truly important to know. If I decide to start my own business such as an accounting firm I hope to be able to rely on some of the skills I learn in her to build an effective website for my clients and customers to use. If not building the site myself, at least have the ability to communicate what I want effectively to the person responsible for building my domain and my site.
